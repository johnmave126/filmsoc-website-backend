		<p>The day has come when 15 movie fans took the first step to serve for Film Society and build strong bonds within each other. Forming a new cabinet named Matrix, we are willing to promote Film Society to a larger scale and draw more attention to the film culture of HKUST. Under the unified leadership, we advanced to make a mutual contribution to the progress of Film Society.</p>
		<p>Going through the rigidity of the promotion period, 15 freshmen valued their friendship more and felt it not an easy task to handle the affairs of the society, yet looked forward to undertaking this responsibility and elaborating the plan.</p>
		<p>With great enthusiasm and diverse talents, we are on our way to the continuity and progress of Film Society. We believe our commitment will make it possible to spread the joy and fantasy of movies within HKUST campus. Ambitious and faithful, we are determined to make Film Society a better group to join in.</p>
		<p>Now the show is on. 15 warriors, aware of the burden and obstacles, summon up the courage to face up to each future challenge. Matrix longs for creativity, development and a new type of life. Under the name of matrix, we want to discover our own merit, and bring Film Society to an utterly new stage.</p>
